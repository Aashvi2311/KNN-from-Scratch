# KNN-from-Scratch

This project implements K Nearest Neighbors from scratch in Python, without using scikit-learn or other machine learning libraries. The dataset used is randomly generated to demonstrate the working of the model.<br>

To validate the implementation, the custom model’s performance is compared with scikit-learn’s KNearestNeighbors. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is computed for both models, and the results are visualized through comparison plots.<br>

The graphs show that predictions from both models are almost identical, with very minimal deviation, confirming the accuracy of the scratch implementation.<br>

The red line represents the predictions from the custom KNN model, while the green line shows the predictions from scikit-learn’s KNN. Both lines closely overlap, indicating that the scratch implementation performs almost identically to the scikit-learn model.
